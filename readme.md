<h1>Docker and Kubernetes Practice</h1>
<h3>Images and Containers</h3>

- Container = "running unit of software"
- Image = "blueprint or template for containers"
- Image contains code and required tools for runtime
- Container executes the code
- Image might contain NodeJS Web App and Environment, which is then used to create multiple containers of the running app (staging, test, prod)
